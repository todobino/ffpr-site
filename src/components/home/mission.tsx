          Amazing breakthroughs in farming techniques are our great hope to reverse the environmental catastrophe that the world currently faces. For decades, modern farming has been a major source of chemical pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions. We believe that Freedom Farms can be a shining example to the world of new farming methods that not only sequester CO2, but also eliminate herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers. All while creating healthier, tastier food.
