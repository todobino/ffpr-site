    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store data related to Freedom Farms' website forms. It includes collections for contact form submissions, career applications, events, and event registrations. To ensure clarity, security, and scalability, each form submission type is stored in its own top-level collection. This structural segregation allows for simplified security rules, as each collection can have its own distinct set of access controls.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** No explicit authorization requirements were specified. Given the nature of the data (form submissions), public write access with strong input validation is assumed for `/contact_form_submissions`, `/career_applications` and `/event_registrations`. The event details are stored in the `/events` collection.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** Since the primary access pattern for submissions is likely administrative review, storing each type in a separate collection ensures that listing operations can be performed securely and efficiently. A rogue user cannot retrieve all submissions by manipulating query parameters, as each collection represents a distinct entity type. Input validation rules will ensure that no malicious script can be added to any of the fields. The events do not have any authorization requirements, assuming they are managed internally by administrators and are readable by anyone."
